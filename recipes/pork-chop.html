        simple to throw together, and they're basically foolproof.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 thick cut pork chops</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon seasoning salt</li>
        <li>2 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white wine</li>
